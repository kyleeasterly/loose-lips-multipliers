Let's start with the overview of the system design.\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: Sure, the design is centered around enhancing communication, navigation, and control capabilities. It includes a robust telemetry system, advanced navigation algorithms, and an efficient control system.\n\nSarah Douglas: Alex, have you considered the material specifications for the telemetry system? The design seems to demand high thermal resistance.\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: Yes, Sarah, I've considered it. However, I'm open to suggestions if you think there's a better material we can use.\n\nSarah Douglas: I think we should consider using a Titanium-Aluminum alloy. It has excellent thermal resistance and is lightweight, which is beneficial for space applications.\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: That sounds like a viable option. We can certainly look into it.\n\nBenjamin Lee: Alex, regarding the navigation algorithms, how are we ensuring precision in the spacecraft's positional data?\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: Good question, Benjamin. We are using a combination of GPS and star tracker data for precise positioning. The design also includes a fail-safe mode using inertial measurement units.\n\nBenjamin Lee: That's a comprehensive approach. I'll start working on the avionics design based on this.\n\nDr. Laura Martinez: I have a question about the control system. Are we using a traditional PID controller or something more advanced?\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: We are planning to use a model predictive control (MPC) system. It allows us to handle constraints more efficiently and can predict future outputs.\n\nDr. Laura Martinez: That's a wise choice. It will make the propulsion system integration smoother.\n\nJohn Stevens: I'm looking forward to testing this system. The design seems robust and innovative.\n\nDuke White: Thanks everyone for the input. Let's incorporate this feedback and finalize the system design. Alex, can you revise the design based on today's discussion?\n\nDr. Alex Thompson: Absolutely, Duke. I'll work on the revisions and aim to have the updated design ready by next week.\n\nDuke White: Great, let's regroup next week to review the updated design.
